# Heuristics

---

> "Heuristic reasoning is often based on induction, or on analogy ... Induction is the process of discovering general laws  ... Induction tries to find regularity and coherence ... Its most conspicuous instruments are generalization, specialization, analogy. [...] Heuristic discusses human behavior in the face of problems [... that have been] preserved in the wisdom of proverbs."
— George Pólya, How to Solve It
