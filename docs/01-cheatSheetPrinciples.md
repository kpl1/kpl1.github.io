# Modern Testing Principles

---

1. Our priority is improving the business.
2. We use models like Lean Thinking and the Theory of Constraints to help identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.
3. We are a force for continuous improvement, and adapt and optimize our practices in order to succeed, rather than using safety nets to catch our failures.
4. We care deeply about the quality culture of our team, and we coach, lead, and nurture our team towards a more mature quality culture.
5. We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product
6. We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and then close the gaps between product hypotheses and business impact.
7. We expand abilities and knowhow across the team; understanding that this may reduce (or eliminate) the need for dedicated specialists.

# Agile Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
